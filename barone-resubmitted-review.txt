This is a review of the resubmitted manuscript by Barone et al entitled "Investigation of the relationship between net force and accelreation in a pulley system". The title and abstract are misnomers as the team tested newton's first law (static) F=0. I recommend minor revision to clarify this.

In methods, the team should explain how the spring scale was calibrated.

The formatting, etc are all fine; but the significance of testing Newton's first law for a straight pulley system is rather trivial.

Contributions and peer review can be condensed into a single acknowledgements section.
